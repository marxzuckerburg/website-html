<h2>About me</h2>

<p>I am <a href="https://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/research/fellows/ryan-heuser">Junior Research Fellow in 'Immateriality' at King's College, Cambridge</a>, where I study English literature and the digital humanities. My work brings computational methods of text analysis to the study of literature and its history. I work on changes in literary language across the modern period; on historical semantics; computational poetics; literary geography; and the theory and methods of the digital humanities more broadly. I recently received my PhD in English from Stanford University, where I was a founding member of the Stanford Literary Lab and its Associate Research Director from 2011 to 2015. You can also find me on <a href="http://twitter.com/quadrismegistus">Twitter</a>; <a href="http://github.com/quadrismegistus">Github</a>; <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EEy82P4AAAAJ">Google Scholar</a>; <a href="https://cambridge.academia.edu/RyanHeuser">Academia.edu</a>; or by email at <a href="mailto:rj416@cam.ac.uk">rj416@cam.ac.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Book projects</h2>

<h3><em>Abstraction: A Literary History</em></h3>

<p>My first book project, <em>Abstraction: A Literary History</em>, traces a slow-moving rise and fall in abstract language across centuries of literary history. Mixing close and distant reading, the book uncovers how these changes in literary semantics mediate changes in social organization. I focus on three literary forms of abstract language: 'abstract style', in the syntactic symmetries and semantic formulae of the periodical essay; 'abstract persons', in the personified abstractions of the mid-century ode; and 'abstract realism', in the "tell, don't show" narration of the early realist novel. Through this history and framework, the book also aims to recuperate abstraction as both a method and an object of literary study.</p>

<h3><em>Computational capitalism</em></h3>

<p>I am also beginning a second book project which examines how computation has changed labor. I return to post-operaismo accounts of immaterial (Hardt &amp; Negri, Lazzarato) or cognitive labor (Vercellone, Boutang); as well as, more recently, <em>post</em>-post-operaismo accounts of digital labor (Huws, Fuchs) or cybernetic capitalism (Dyer-Witheford); but admit that such frameworks never fully escaped their frequent criticism that they overemphasise the (allegedly new) cognitive dimensions of labor at the expense of the continued material basis of both production (in the global South) and reproduction (in the home). If abstract, as such debates about 'immaterial' and 'material' labor have in fact suddenly become tangible and concrete in the Covid-19 employment crisis, its plunging divide between between workers who can and cannot work 'from home' -- and those who must risk their material body. What kind of labor can undergo such spatial dislocation? Primarily, that taking place on networked digital computers. In collaboration with other critics of digital capitalism, this book argues that leftists take more seruously the structural role of computation to labor.</p>

<h2>Collaborations</h2>

<h3>Cambridge Keydata Project</h3>

<p>I am directing a new collaborative digital humanities project based working at the intersection of computational semantics and conceptual history—the title alluding to Raymond Williams' classic 1976 text, Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society. Co-directed with Pete de Bolla, Prof. of English there, and bringing together linguists, computer scientists, literary scholars, historians of political thought, and others, to join in a shared project in digital knowledge. Based in Cambridge, the project is also open to virtual collaboration (as, indeed, everything now is)—do get in touch if you have.</p>

<h3>Antimetricality</h3>

<p>I am working with Arto Anttila and Paul Kiparsky, metrical phonologists at Stanford, to design tools to evaluate the 'antimetricality' of a text: the degree to which its stress patterns depart from any known metrical pattern. Such measurements of metrical 'tension' or 'ambiguity' have a history: prose most distances itself rhythmically from verse at the height of the eighteenth century. We have a pre-print of a paper available <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~kiparsky/Papers/Antimetricality-Draft-2018-04-20.pdf">here</a>. </p>

<h2>Blog</h2>

<h3>Word Vectors in the Eighteenth Century</h3>

<p>This page is meant as a set of links and resources related to my work using word vectors to study eighteenth-century literature. This work asks the question: how can new vector-based models of semantics reveal the historicity of specific configurations of meaning in eighteenth-century literature? Most of this work is published serially as blog posts, linked below. The later of these are "slideshow essays"-experiments with the forms of visual rhetoric that work so well in the digital humanities-rather than traditional blog posts. There is also a video of a talk I've given about this work. Lastly, I've uploaded several word2vec models I'm using, trained on a corpus of eighteenth-century literature; and linked to some relevant code (more code will be coming soon).</p>
